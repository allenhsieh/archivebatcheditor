## 💻 Step 3: Download & Install

### 3A. Download the Code
**Option 1: Download ZIP (Easiest)**
- Click the green **"Code"** button on this page
- Click **"Download ZIP"**
- Extract it to your Desktop or Documents folder

---

## 🔧 Step 4: Add Your API Keys

**Create your secret configuration file:**

### 4A. Create .env File
1. **In your project folder**, create a new file called `.env` (exactly that name)
2. **Copy and paste this template:**

```bash
# 🔐 Archive.org credentials (REQUIRED - get from step 2)
ARCHIVE_ACCESS_KEY=paste_your_access_key_here
ARCHIVE_SECRET_KEY=paste_your_secret_key_here  
ARCHIVE_EMAIL=paste_your_email_here

# 🎥 YouTube integration (OPTIONAL - get from step 2)
YOUTUBE_API_KEY=paste_your_youtube_api_key_here
YOUTUBE_CHANNEL_ID=paste_your_channel_id_here

# ⚙️ Server settings (leave these as-is)
PORT=3001
NODE_ENV=development
```

### 4B. Replace the Placeholders
- **Replace** `paste_your_access_key_here` with your real Archive.org access key
- **Replace** `paste_your_secret_key_here` with your real Archive.org secret key  
- **Replace** `paste_your_email_here` with your Archive.org email
- **If you got YouTube keys:** replace those placeholders too
- **If no YouTube:** just leave those lines as-is or delete them

### 4C. Save and Secure
✅ **Save the file**  
🔒 **Never share this file** - it contains your passwords!  
🚫 **Don't post it online** - the app automatically keeps it private

---

## 🚀 Step 5: Start the App

**You need TWO terminal windows:**

<!-- TODO: Add screenshot showing two terminals running -->

### Terminal 1: Start the Server
```bash
npm run server:dev
```
**You should see:**
- "Server running on port 3001" ✅
- "Server ready with quota-aware YouTube integration" ✅  
- "Archive.org credentials loaded successfully" ✅

### Terminal 2: Start the Website  
```bash
npm run dev
```
**You should see:**
- "Local: http://localhost:3000" ✅

---

## 🎉 Step 6: Open the App

**Go to:** [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### 🔄 Step 1: Load Your Archive.org Collection

1. **Click the big "Load My Items" button**  
2. **Wait 5-10 seconds** while it fetches your uploads  
3. **See all your Archive.org items** appear in the list ✅

---

### ✏️ Step 2: Basic Metadata Editing

**Want to update titles, descriptions, or other info? Here's how:**

1. **☑️ Check the boxes** next to items you want to edit
2. **➕ Click "Add Field"** and pick what to change (title, creator, description, etc.)
3. **✏️ Type your new value** in the text box
4. **🚀 Click "Update X Items"** button  
5. **👀 Watch the magic!** Each item updates with live progress:
   - 🔄 **Blue spinning** = currently updating
   - ✅ **Green checkmark** = success!  
   - ❌ **Red X** = error (shows why)

<!-- TODO: Add screenshot showing the metadata editing interface -->

**Pro Tips:**
- ⚡ **Batch power:** Select 50+ items and update them all at once!
- 🎯 **Replace mode:** Your new value completely replaces the old one
- 📝 **Test first:** Try with 1-2 items before doing large batches

### 🎥 Step 3: YouTube Auto-Matching (Optional)

**Have YouTube videos of the same content? Auto-match them!**

**How it works:**
1. **☑️ Select Archive.org items** you want to match
2. **🔍 Click "Get YouTube Match"** button  
3. **⏳ Wait while it searches** YouTube for matching videos
4. **👁️ Review suggestions** - it extracts band names, venues, dates automatically!
5. **Choose what to apply:**
   - 🔗 **"Add YouTube Links"** = Just adds the YouTube URL  
   - ✅ **"Apply All Selected Fields"** = Adds URL + extracted metadata

<!-- TODO: Add screenshot showing YouTube matching interface with suggestions -->

**What gets extracted:**
- 🎸 **Band/Artist name** from video titles  
- 🏛️ **Venue name** (like "The Fillmore")  
- 📅 **Date** from video descriptions  
- 🔗 **YouTube URL** for cross-referencing

---

### ⚡ Pro Features

**🔄 Sequential Processing**
- **One at a time:** Processes items sequentially for reliability
- **Fail-fast:** Stops on first error to preserve API quota
- **Fresh data:** Always fetches latest information from APIs
- **Status:** See real-time processing updates in the server terminal

**📊 Real-Time Progress**
- **Live updates:** Watch each item process in real-time
- **Error handling:** See exactly which items failed and why
- **Streaming:** Progress updates even if you have 100+ items
- **Quota-aware:** Stops immediately on YouTube API quota exhaustion to preserve usage

**🔒 Security & Privacy**  
- **Local only:** Runs on your computer, not in the cloud
- **API keys:** Stored securely in .env file  
- **No tracking:** Your data stays with you

## 🚨 Help! Something's Not Working

**Don't panic! Here are the most common fixes:**

---

### 😵 "No Items Loading" or Empty List

**Most common fixes:**
1. **Check your .env file:**
   - Is your Archive.org email correct?
   - Did you paste the right access/secret keys?  
   - No extra spaces or quotes around your keys?

2. **Try refreshing:**
   - Click the **"🔄 Refresh"** button
   - Wait 10-15 seconds for fresh data

3. **Check the server terminal:**
   - Look for red error messages  
   - Common: "Invalid credentials" or "Access denied"

**Still not working?** Your Archive.org account might not have any public items, or your credentials expired.

---

### 🎥 "YouTube Match Not Found" or "Rate Limit"

**Don't worry - YouTube is optional!** Your main app still works perfectly.

**Common YouTube issues:**
- **Quota exhausted:** YouTube API has daily limits. The app automatically detects quota exhaustion and stops immediately to preserve remaining quota
- **No matches:** Not all Archive items have YouTube versions - totally normal!
- **Wrong Channel ID:** Double-check it starts with `UC` and matches your actual channel

**Quick fix:** Just use the app without YouTube matching - still super powerful!

---

### 💻 "Server Won't Start" or Terminal Errors

**Check these basics:**
1. **Node.js installed?** Type `node --version` - should show v18+
2. **Wrong folder?** Make sure you're in the project folder
3. **Ports busy?** Close other apps using ports 3000/3001
4. **Try reinstalling:** Run `npm install` again

**Mac users with SQLite errors:**
```bash
xcode-select --install
```

**Still stuck?** Delete the whole folder, re-download, and start over - sometimes that's fastest!

---

### 🔄 "Items Stuck Processing" or Updates Not Showing

**Quick fixes:**
1. **Refresh the webpage** (F5 or Cmd+R)
2. **Check your internet** - updates stream live
3. **Look at server terminal** - shows detailed progress even if UI breaks
4. **Wait it out** - large batches can take 5-10 minutes

---

### 🗄️ "Database or Server Errors"

**Nuclear option (fixes most issues):**
1. **Close both terminals** (Ctrl+C)
2. **Clear any temporary files:** Delete any old cache files if they exist
3. **Restart everything:** `npm run server:dev` and `npm run dev`
4. **Server starts fresh** ✅

---

### 🆘 Still Need Help?

**Before asking for help, gather this info:**
- What error message do you see exactly?
- What step were you on when it broke?
- Are both terminals still running?
- What does your `.env` file look like? (**Don't share the actual keys!**)

**Where to get help:**
- Open a GitHub Issue with your error details
- Check if others had the same problem in existing Issues

---

## 🔐 Important Security Reminders

**Keep your API keys safe:**
- 🚫 **Never share your `.env` file** - treat it like your password
- 🚫 **Don't post screenshots** of your `.env` file  
- 🚫 **Don't commit it to git** - the app automatically ignores it
- ✅ **Test with 1-2 items first** before doing big batches

**The app is secure by design:**
- 🏠 **Runs locally** - your keys never leave your computer  
- 🎯 **Surgical updates** - only changes the metadata you specify
- 👁️ **Transparent** - you see exactly what changes before applying

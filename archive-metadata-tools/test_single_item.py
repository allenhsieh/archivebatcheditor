"""
Test metadata fix for a single item using internetarchive library.

This is a TESTING AND DEBUGGING tool for trying metadata updates on individual items
before running the full batch process on all 499 items.

Use this script when you want to:
- Test if a metadata update works on a specific item
- Debug issues with metadata updates
- Verify that changes are applied correctly
- See detailed output about what's happening

For beginners:
- This is like a "practice run" before doing the real thing
- It's much safer to test on one item than to break 499 items
- You can modify the test data at the bottom of this file
- The output shows exactly what changes are being made

class MetadataFixerTest:
    """
    A class that handles testing metadata updates on individual Archive.org items.
    
    Think of a class like a blueprint for creating objects that can do specific tasks.
    This class is designed for testing and debugging - it provides detailed output
    about what's happening during metadata updates.
    
    For beginners:
    - This is essentially the same as the main MetadataFixerIA class
    - But with extra debugging output to help understand what's happening
    - __init__ is a special method that runs when you create a new instance
    - self refers to the specific instance of this class

"""
Find Archive.org items with Facebook event links.

This script searches through your Archive.org items looking for Facebook event links
in descriptions and metadata fields. It's designed to help find items that might
have associated flyers that could be uploaded.

The script looks for:
- Facebook event links in description fields
- Facebook links in 'fb' or 'facebook' metadata fields
- Various Facebook URL formats (facebook.com/events/, fb.me/, m.facebook.com/events/)

For beginners:
- Archive.org is a digital library where we store music recordings
- Metadata is information ABOUT the files (like band name, date, venue, description)
- This script connects to Archive.org's API to search through your uploaded items
- JSON is a text format for storing structured data (like a Python dictionary)
- Regular expressions (regex) are patterns used to find specific text formats
"""

import json  # For reading/writing JSON files (JavaScript Object Notation)
import re    # For regular expressions (pattern matching in text)
import time  # For adding delays between API requests (rate limiting)

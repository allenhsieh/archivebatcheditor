Apply metadata fixes from metadata_issues.json to Archive.org using internetarchive library

This is the MAIN SCRIPT that applies all metadata changes to Archive.org items.
It reads the metadata_issues.json file and updates each item with:
- Missing band names
- Missing venue names  
- Corrected date formats (YYYY-MM-DD)

For beginners:
- Archive.org is a digital library where we store music recordings
- Metadata is information ABOUT the files (like band name, date, venue)
- This script connects to Archive.org's API to update that information
- JSON is a text format for storing structured data (like a Python dictionary)

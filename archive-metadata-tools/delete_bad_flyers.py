"""
Delete bad flyer filenames with timestamp suffixes from Archive.org items.

This script removes files like '2016-02-27T00:00:00Z-flyer_itemimage.jpg'
while keeping the clean versions like '2016-02-27-flyer_itemimage.jpg'.

The problem:
- Archive.org sometimes creates duplicate flyer files with timestamp suffixes
- These bad files have 'T00:00:00Z' in their names (ISO 8601 timestamp format)
- We want to keep only the clean versions without timestamps
- This clutters the archive and confuses users

For beginners:
- Archive.org is a digital library where we store music recordings
- Files are stored in 'items' (like folders) with unique identifiers
- This script uses the Archive.org command-line interface (CLI) to delete files
- subprocess lets Python run command-line programs
"""

# Import statements - these bring in code libraries we need

    A class that handles deleting bad flyer files from specific Archive.org items.
    
    Think of a class like a blueprint for creating objects that can do specific tasks.
    This class knows how to:
    1. Load Archive.org credentials from environment variables
    2. Find files with bad timestamp suffixes in Archive.org items
    3. Delete those files using the internetarchive CLI
    4. Keep track of which items were processed successfully

    - self refers to the specific instance of this class
    - Environment variables are a secure way to store passwords and API keys
